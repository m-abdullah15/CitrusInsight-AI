                    <li> Keep an eye on baby mealybugs by spraying control where they appear. For this purpose, apply chloropyriphos 25 ml of methidathion 25 ml or profenofos 25 ml per liter of water on tree trunks from two to two and a half feet above the ground and in the canopy of the plant. Spray on the ground below</li>      
                    <li> Take measures to protect plants from the harmful effects of fog, especially by pruning and thinning trees like bamboo or other tall trees around the orchards, to allow sunlight and air to pass through the orchards.</li>
                    <li> Anticipating frosty nights, make sure to apply a light watering to the orchards.</li>
                    <li> If organic fertilizer was not applied in December, ensure to apply 50 to 60 kilograms of well-rotted manure in January. Avoid relying solely on poultry manure.</p> 
                    <li> After applying fertilizers, irrigate the orchards.</li>
                    <li> Carry out the task of inspecting the ripeness and harvesting of fruit during the day after the dew has dried.</li>

                    <li> Focus special attention on protecting plants from the harmful effects of cold and apply light irrigation to orchards on frosty nights.</li>
                    <li> To eliminate insects emerging from mealybug eggs, spray appropriate insecticides, and limit the spray to areas where mealybug larvae are visible. Preferably, spray Chlorpyrifos or Profenofos at 3 ml per liter of water up to 3 feet height on the tree trunk to effectively control mealybug larvae.</li>
                    <li> Ensure the application of organic fertilizers to plants in December.</li>
                    <li> Start harvesting Kinnow oranges at the end of December, as by then, the fruit reaches its acceptable level of ripeness and internal sweetness. However, the harvesting process should be carried out using standard methods after assessing ripeness.</li>
                    <li> The harvesting of most varieties of oranges and grapefruit should be completed within this month.</li>
